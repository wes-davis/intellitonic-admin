# 🧠 AI Context Rules System

## 🌟 Quick Overview
A streamlined system for managing AI interactions through memory management, lessons learned tracking, and dual-mode operation (Plan/Act).

## 🔄 Core Flow
1. **Memory System** (`@memories.md`)
   - Tracks all interactions
   - Updates automatically
   - Maintains project context

2. **Lessons Learned** (`@lessons-learned.md`)
   - Captures solutions
   - Documents best practices
   - Prevents repeated issues

3. **Scratchpad** (`@scratchpad.md`)
   - Manages current phase
   - Tracks implementation
   - Monitors confidence

## 🎯 How It Works

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B[Plan Mode 🎯]
    B --> C[Check Rules]
    C --> D[Read Memories]
    D --> E[Verify Requirements]
    E --> F{95% Confidence?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Act Mode ⚡]
    F -->|No| H[Ask Questions]
    H --> D
```

## 🚀 Usage Flow

1. **Start: Plan Mode** 🎯
   ```
   - Trigger: "plan"
   - System reads: @memories.md, @lessons-learned.md
   - Checks: project requirements
   - Builds: confidence score
   ```

2. **Transition: 95% Confidence**
   ```
   - All questions answered
   - Requirements verified
   - Implementation path clear
   ```

3. **Execute: Act Mode** ⚡
   ```
   - Trigger: "agent"
   - Implements solution
   - Updates documentation
   - Tracks progress
   ```

## 💡 Key Rules

1. **Always Active**
   - Brain-memories-lessons-learned rules
   - Documentation standards
   - Project requirements

2. **Mode System**
   - Plan Mode (Default)
   - Act Mode (95% confidence)
   - Clear transitions

3. **Documentation**
   - Real-time updates
   - Cross-referencing
   - Phase tracking

## 🎯 Tips & Tricks

### 🔄 Handling AI Hallucinations & Cursor Issues
1. **Open Required Tabs**:
   ```
   1️⃣ Active file you're working on
   2️⃣ Cursor Settings (Feature tab → Resync Index)
   3️⃣ .cursorrules file (keep open for auto-reload)
   ```

2. **Reload Process**:
   ```
   1. Press Ctrl+Shift+P
   2. Type "Developer: Reload Window"
   3. Wait 3-10 seconds for complete reload
   ```

3. **When to Use**:
   - AI seems confused or unresponsive
   - Cursor not working properly
   - Unexpected behavior
   - Need to refresh codebase indexing

### 💡 Additional Tips
- Best practices for memory management
- Efficient confidence building
- Quick mode transitions
- Documentation shortcuts
- Common pitfalls to avoid
