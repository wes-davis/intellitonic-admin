*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (üéØ) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (‚ö°) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (üéØ) ‚Üí 95% confidence ‚Üí Agent mode (‚ö°)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (üéØ) ‚Üí Chain of thought analysis ‚Üí Agent mode (‚ö°)

     - State persistence
     - Option handling
     - Transient caching
   - [ ] State change hooks
     - Pre/post activation hooks
     - State validation
   - [ ] Feature dependency handling
     - Dependency checks
     - Conflict resolution

2. Admin UI Development (2 days)
   - [ ] Feature toggle interface
     - Toggle controls
     - Status indicators
     - Dependency display
   - [ ] Dynamic menu system
     - Feature-based menus
     - Permission handling
   - [ ] Settings persistence
     - Data validation
     - Sanitization
     - Error handling

3. Email Settings Feature (3 days)

     - Settings structure
     - Activation hooks
   - [ ] Settings page
     - Form controls
     - Validation rules
     - Save handling
   - [ ] WordPress integration
     - Email filters
     - Testing hooks
     - Error handling
   - [ ] Unit tests
     - Feature tests
     - Integration tests

### Progress Tracking
- Current Phase: 1 - Feature Toggle System
- Status: Planning Stage
- Confidence: 90%

### Questions for Implementation
1. Feature State:
   - What's the required persistence mechanism for feature states?
   - How should we handle feature dependencies?
   - What hooks are needed for state changes?

2. Admin UI:
   - What validation rules are needed for settings?
   - How should we handle feature conflicts?
   - What permission levels are required?

3. Email Settings:
   - Which WordPress email filters need integration?
   - What settings fields are required?
   - How should we handle email testing?

### Next Steps
1. **Feature State Management**
   ```
   - Implement registry system
   - Add state persistence
   - Create hook system
   ```

2. **Admin UI**
   ```
   - Build toggle interface
   - Implement menu handling
   - Add settings system
   ```

3. **Email Settings Feature**
   ```
   - Create feature class
   - Build settings page
   - Add email filters
   - Write tests
   ```

### Dependencies
- WordPress Settings API
- WP_List_Table
- PHPUnit

### Security Considerations
- Nonce verification
- Capability checks
- Data sanitization
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection

### Documentation Requirements
- Feature API docs
- Hook documentation
- Integration guide
- Testing guide

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Before proceeding, we need clarification on:
1. Feature state persistence mechanism
2. Required permission levels
3. Email settings requirements
4. Testing scope

Please provide these details to reach 95% confidence and move to implementation phase. üòä
