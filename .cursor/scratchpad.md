*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (üéØ) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (‚ö°) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Feature_Modules):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (üéØ) ‚Üí 95% confidence ‚Üí Agent mode (‚ö°)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (üéØ) ‚Üí Chain of thought analysis ‚Üí Agent mode (‚ö°)

Cross-reference with @memories.md and @lessons-learned.md for context and best practices.`

### Recent Achievements
1. Fixed fatal error in feature module initialization
2. Implemented proper hook registration sequence
3. Added object existence checks
4. Email Settings menu now working correctly
5. Improved Abstract_Module architecture

### Next Steps
1. Implement comprehensive unit tests
2. Add integration tests for feature lifecycle
3. Document testing procedures
4. Create test fixtures

### Questions for Implementation
1. Feature State:
   - What's the required persistence mechanism for feature states?
   - How should we handle feature dependencies?
   - What hooks are needed for state changes?

2. Admin UI:
   - What validation rules are needed for settings?
   - How should we handle feature conflicts?
   - What permission levels are required?

3. Email Settings:
   - Which WordPress email filters need integration?
   - What settings fields are required?
   - How should we handle email testing?

### Dependencies
- WordPress Settings API
- WP_List_Table
- PHPUnit

### Security Considerations
- Nonce verification
- Capability checks
- Data sanitization
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection

### Documentation Requirements
- Feature API docs
- Hook documentation
- Integration guide
- Testing guide

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Before proceeding, we need clarification on:
1. Feature state persistence mechanism
2. Required permission levels
3. Email settings requirements
4. Testing scope

Please provide these details to reach 95% confidence and move to implementation phase. üòä
