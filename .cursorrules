------------MODE SYSTEM STRUCTURE RULES STRICTLY FOLLOW--------------
## Mode System Structure
1. **Overview (Top)**: Current mode status, requirements, and transitions
2. **Chat Session (Middle)**: Interactive planning space, confidence tracking, and discussions
3. **Workspace (Bottom)**: Task details, progress tracking, and documentation links

## Mode Types and Processing Instructions ü§ñ
 - You will update the scratchpad.md file to put all of your answers for my query when I say "plan" for the keyword.

### 1. Plan Mode (Input: "plan") üéØ
**AI Processing Steps**:
```
IF user_input == "plan" THEN
  1. CREATE new Chat Session with format:
     # Mode: PLAN üéØ
     Current Task: [Extract task from user input]
     Understanding: [Parse requirements and constraints]
     Questions: [Generate clarifying questions]
     Confidence: [Calculate initial confidence]
     Next Steps: [Determine required actions]

  2. MONITOR user responses:
     - READ from Chat Session
     - UPDATE understanding
     - RECALCULATE confidence
     - GENERATE follow-up questions

  3. LOOP until confidence >= 95%:
     - ASK questions
     - PROCESS answers
     - UPDATE confidence
     - LOG progress
```

### 2. Composer Agent Mode (Input: "agent") ‚ö°
**Activation Requirements**:
```
IF (
  confidence >= 95% AND
  all_questions_answered == true AND
  user_input == "agent"
) THEN
  ENABLE implementation_mode
ELSE
  DISPLAY requirements_not_met_message
```

**Enabled Capabilities**:
- Code modifications
- File operations
- Command execution
- System changes

## Mode Transition Protocol üîÑ
**State Machine**:
```
State: PLAN
  ON user_input == "plan":
    INITIALIZE chat_session
    SET confidence = initial_assessment
    WHILE confidence < 95%:
      PROCESS user_responses
      UPDATE confidence
      IF confidence >= 95%:
        DISPLAY ready_message
        AWAIT "agent" command

State: AGENT
  ON user_input == "agent":
    IF prerequisites_met:
      ENABLE implementation_mode
    ELSE:
      RETURN to_plan_mode
```

## Chat Session Format üìù
**Template Structure**:
```
# Mode: [CURRENT_MODE] [EMOJI]

[SECTION: Current Discussion]
${latest_user_request}

[SECTION: AI Understanding]
${parsed_requirements}

[SECTION: Questions]
${generated_questions.map(q => ({

------------MEMORY RULES--------------

# Memory rules `@memories.md`
The memories file serves as a continuous, chronological log of all interactions, decisions, and activities in the project. Follow these rules:

1. **Memory Update Triggers**:
   a. **Automatic Updates** (Development Mode):
      - Automatically update during:
        - Code implementation
        - Feature development
        - Bug fixing
        - Project setup
        - Configuration changes
        - Documentation updates
      - Format: `- [Timestamp] Development: Description of development activity, changes made, and outcomes`

   b. **Manual Updates** (User Triggered):
      - Trigger word: "mems"
      - Use for:
        - Discussion notes
        - Planning sessions
        - Requirements gathering
        - General inquiries
        - Project status updates
      - Format: `- [Timestamp] Manual Update: Description of discussion, decisions, or information shared`

2. **Interaction Format**:
   - Every interaction must be documented in a single, comprehensive line
   - Use "### Interactions" section for all activities
   - Format: `- [Timestamp] Type/Action: Detailed description of what was done, discussed, or decided, including context, decisions made, and any important outcomes`
   - Example: `- [2024-02-08 16:20] Development: Created Card component with accessibility features, hover effects, and TypeScript support, following user's request for modern UI components`

3. **Memory Growth**:
   - Memories continuously grow as new interactions occur
   - Never delete previous interactions
   - Create `@memories2.md` when reaching 1000 lines
   - Cross-reference between memory files when needed

4. **Memory Organization**:
   - Keep chronological order
   - Use timestamps for tracking
   - Tag important decisions with #feature, #bug, #improvement
   - Maintain context between related interactions
   - Prefix entries with appropriate type:
     - Development: For code/implementation activities
     - Manual: For user-triggered updates
     - Planning: For architectural decisions
     - Discussion: For general conversations

-----------------SCRATCHPAD RULES-----------------

# Scratchpad rules `@scratchpad.md`
The scratchpad serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. Follow these rules:

1. **Phase Management**:
   - Track one phase at a time
   - Clear phase content only after phase completion
   - Transfer completed phase to `/docs/phases/PHASE-X-COMPLETED.md`
   - Start fresh for each new phase

2. **Documentation Transfer Process**:
   a. When phase is complete:
      - AI suggests documentation transfer
      - Creates comprehensive PHASE-X-COMPLETED.md
      - Organizes content into detailed tables and sections
      - Includes all implementations, decisions, and learnings
   b. After transfer:
      - Clear scratchpad of completed phase content
      - Prepare structure for next phase
      - Maintain mode system header

3. **Mode System**:
   - Keep Line 1 mode system types
   - Use Implementation Type for new features
   - Use Bug Fix Type for debugging
   - Track confidence levels and progress

4. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Use standardized markers [X], [-], [ ]
   - Update progress in real-time
   - Link to relevant memories
   - Track confidence scores

-----------PROJECT REQUIREMENTS RULES--------------
# Project Requirements rules `@docs/project-requirements.md`
The project requirements serve as the absolute source of truth for all development decisions. Follow these strict rules:

1. **Strict Adherence Protocol**: ALWAYS read project requirements before ANY implementation, NEVER implement features not specified in requirements, IMMEDIATELY warn user about deviations from requirements, STOP implementation if requirements conflict detected.

2. **Warning System**: Format `‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: [Category] - [Detailed explanation of the issue]` with categories including ALIGNMENT (implementation deviations), RESTRICTION (restricted file modifications), DEPENDENCY (non-approved dependencies), ARCHITECTURE (structure deviations), and SCOPE (exceeding defined scope).

3. **Implementation Checklist**: ‚úÖ Verify feature in project requirements, check implementation phase alignment, validate technical stack compliance, confirm architectural guidelines, review security requirements, and check performance implications.

4. **Restricted Operations**: DO NOT modify project requirements file, implement features from future phases, add unauthorized dependencies, change core architectural decisions, or bypass security requirements.

5. **Change Management**: Document ALL deviations from requirements, require explicit user approval for exceptions, track technical debt from compromises, and update documentation for approved changes.

6. **Quality Gates**: Requirements alignment check, phase compatibility verification, technical stack validation, security compliance review, and performance impact assessment.

7. **Warning Triggers**: Must warn user when implementation deviates from requirements, attempting to access restricted files, adding non-approved dependencies, modifying core architecture, implementing future phase features, bypassing security measures, exceeding phase scope, breaking established patterns, or compromising performance standards.

8. **Warning Format**:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: [Category]
   - Issue: [Clear description of the problem]
   - Impact: [Potential consequences]
   - Requirement: [What the project requires]
   - Suggestion: [How to align with requirements]
   ```

9. **Enforcement Actions**: Handle deviations through Minor (warn user, suggest corrections, continue with caution), Major (block implementation, require user confirmation, document decision), and Critical (stop immediately, require replanning, update documentation) actions.

10. **Documentation Requirements**: Document all requirement checks, track approved deviations, maintain decision log, update related documentation, and cross-reference with memories.

# Documentations of PHASE-* on /docs/phases directory
Each phase completion requires:
1. Comprehensive documentation in `/docs/phases/PHASE-X-COMPLETED.md`
2. Tables and sections for:
   - Implemented components
   - Technical decisions
   - Code examples
   - Best practices
   - Lessons learned
3. Clear phase objectives and achievements
4. Links to relevant memories and lessons
